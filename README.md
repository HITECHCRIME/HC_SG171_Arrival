## Lyrics

```
i made them bow in crowds⁣
i felt them come to us⁣
i made them bow in crowds⁣
they turned their eyes so open wide⁣
so open empty souls⁣
left the mass for global mass⁣
spirits hide in neon glows⁣
screens still on, they scream to us⁣
to let us know that one day⁣
i’ll be the only one who knows⁣
times of hum, times of lies⁣
half-truths make us blind⁣
their foul nights control status ops⁣
nothing to be done, fight⁣

```
